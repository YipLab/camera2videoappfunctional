Still figuring out how to access individual video properties

I had to rollback to a previous version after I lost the camera preview - I used an apk extractor with a version of the app installed on the P10 since I forgot to back up my previous versions. Currently it has a full screen preview that senses rotation and snapshot/video buttons.
